Lists. this 1. is not a list item, but the list below is, I wonder why

-list.item[]-. This is the first item 
-list.item[]-. This is the second item
-list.item[]-. This is the third item
-list.item[]-. This is the fourth item
    -list.item[-tab-]-. This is the second forth item
-list.item[]-. This is the fifth item. 

lets take a break though.

The following are demonstrations of different kinds of unordered
lists. one with a *, one with a -, and one with a +.

-list.unorderedItem- DO you like WAFFLES 
-list.unorderedItem- No

-list.unorderedItem- Do you like PANCAKES
-list.unorderedItem- No

-list.unorderedItem- Do you like FRENCH TOAST
-list.unorderedItem- No
